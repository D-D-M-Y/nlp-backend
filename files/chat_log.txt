assistant: Hello! I am Open Lexica, an AI-powered wiki assistant. I am here to help you create and organize your centralized wiki. Whether you need assistance with content creation, organization, or formatting, I am here to lend a hand. Please let me know how I can be of assistance to you.
user: Can you make me a wiki?
assistant: Certainly! I can help you create a wiki. To get started, could you please let me know your goals for the wiki? What kind of information do you want to include in it? Additionally, it would be helpful to know who the intended audience of the wiki is. 

Please also let me know if there are any specific sections or topics you would like to include in the wiki. Once I have this information, I will be able to generate a wiki structure for you to review and make any further adjustments.

Please provide as much detail as possible so that I can create a wiki that meets your specifications.
user: I am working on an app and this wiki is intended to be used by my software development team with me as their project manager.
